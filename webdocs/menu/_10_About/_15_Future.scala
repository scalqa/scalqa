/**
 * One thing is for sure, Scalqa will always be free and open source
 *
 * If it gets enough market traction, it will be a community maintained GitHub project
 *
 * Datamata Corporation will lead the effort for another year or two, but it would not have resources to maintain Scalqa to its full potential
 *
 * In case of low interest, Datamata will maintain the project in perpetuity, but will focus on around its own development needs
