/**
 *   `Scalqa.Fx` is an easy to use [[scalqa.Fx GUI API]]
 *
 *   It is a wrapper around JavaFx, which is quite challenging to work with directly
 *
 *   The complex data model is completely replaced with Scalqa's observable [[Observable_Properties properties]] and [[Simple_Collections collections]]
 *
 *   Note. `Scalqa.Fx` is not an integral part of Scalqa core, but rather an optional module with separate JAR
