/**
 *  `Hierarchical Objects Organization`
 *
 *  One of the most precious resource in todays programming is name space. Every imaginable piece of functionality, we might need, already exists.
 *  The challenge is to make accessing it cheaper, then the potential benefits. Often times 'import' statements are not justified
 *  to bring in trivial functionality
 *
 *  In Scalqa the answer is H2O. Thanks to [[Package_Type Package Type]]s, which can include other types, it is possible to build deep object hierarchies
 *  with natural names
 *
 *  For example, [[scalqa.Idx.Range.Reposition Idx.Range.Reposition]] is an object 3 levels down the hierarchy, nevertheless, accessed by full name from the root name space
 *
 *  Thanks to H2O, there is almost no 'import' statements in Scalqa code
 *
