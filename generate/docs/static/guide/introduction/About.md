It is a simplified library for Scala3, designed to replace use of more complex language native API. 

Scalqa is built around fast proprietary collections framework, which supports unboxed processing of primitive types.

Scalqa also provides a standardized way to define [opaque data](https://scalqa.org/doc/guide/features/Data.html) based on Java primitives. 
Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.

[scalqa.Fx](https://scalqa.org/doc/api/scalqa/Fx$.html) provides GUI functionality, based on JavaFx.

Scalqa is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/scalqa/scalqa).
