**Scalqa** stands for 'Scala Quick API'. It is an alternative library for Scala3, which would allow development without using most of native language API.

Scalqa features a proprietary, greatly simplified, but significantly faster collections framework.

Scalqa also provides a standardized way to define opaque data types, 
based on Java primitives, which naturally inherit specialized collections, taking processing speed on entire new level.

[scalqa.Fx](../../api/scalqa/Fx$.html) provides GUI functionality, based on JavaFx.

Scalqa is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/scalqa/scalqa).
