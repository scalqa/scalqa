**Scalqa** stands for 'Scala Quick API'. 

It is a simplified API for Scala3 language, built around fast proprietary collections framework.

Scalqa also provides a standardized way to define opaque data types, 
based on Java primitives, which naturally inherit specialized collections, taking processing speed on entire new level.

[scalqa.Fx](../../api/scalqa/Fx$.html) provides GUI functionality, based on JavaFx.

Scalqa is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/scalqa/scalqa).
