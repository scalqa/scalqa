**Scalqa** stands for 'Scala Quick API'. 

It is a simplified API for Scala3 language, built around fast proprietary collections framework.

Scalqa also provides a standardized way to define [opaque data types](https://scalqa.org/doc/guide/features/Data.html), 
based on Java primitives, which naturally inherit specialized collections, taking processing speed on entire new level.

[scalqa.Fx](https://scalqa.org/doc/api/scalqa/Fx$.html) provides GUI functionality, based on JavaFx.
