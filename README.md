Scala has a reputation of harder language to learn, which is to a large extent due to complex, overcrowded API.
**Scalqa** stands for 'Scala Quick API'. It provides full functionality with minimal, simplified libraries. 

Scalqa collections are fully specialized and allow processing of primitive types without boxing.

Scalqa also provides a standardized way to define [opaque data](https://scalqa.org/doc/guide/features/Data.html)
based on Java primitives. Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.

[scalqa.Fx](https://scalqa.org/doc/api/scalqa/Fx$.html) provides GUI functionality, based on [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io).
