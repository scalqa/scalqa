**Scalqa** stands for 'Scala Quick API'. It provides basic language API focused on faster minimalistic collections. 

In comparison, Scala native collections are unnecessarily complex, because they are based an idea of "rich" interfaces, when every possible method is included in every class. 

Scalqa collections are also fully specialized and allow processing of primitive types without boxing, 
delivering dramatic benefits in speed and memory consumption.

Scalqa also provides a standardized way to define [opaque data](https://scalqa.github.io/Guide/Features/Data.html)
based on Java primitives. Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.

[scalqa.Fx](https://scalqa.github.io/api/scalqa/Fx$.html) provides GUI functionality, based on [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io). 
The GUI is an add-on feature and will probably be a separate module in the future.
