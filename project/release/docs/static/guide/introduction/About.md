**Scalqa** stands for 'Scala Quick API'. It replaces more complex Scala native API, when simplicity and speed are a priority.

Scalqa is built around fast proprietary collections, which support unboxed processing of primitive types.

Scalqa also provides a standardized way to define [opaque data](https://scalqa.org/doc/guide/features/Data.html) based on Java primitives. 
Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.

[scalqa.Fx](https://scalqa.org/doc/api/scalqa/Fx$.html) provides GUI functionality, based on [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io).

Scalqa is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/scalqa/scalqa).
