**Scalqa** stands for 'Scala Quick API'. 
It provides basic language API focused on faster minimalistic collections.

Scalqa collections are fully specialized and allow processing of primitive types without boxing, 
delivering dramatic benefits in speed and memory consumption.

Scalqa also provides a standardized way to define [opaque data](../features/Data.html) based on Java primitives. 
Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.

[scalqa.Fx](../../api/scalqa/Fx$.html) provides GUI functionality, based on [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io).
The GUI is an add-on feature and will probably be a separate module in the future.

Scalqa is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/scalqa/scalqa).
