There is a sub-project of sample use [examples](https://github.com/scalqa/scalqa/tree/master/sample/src/example) available on GitHub. 
It also contains many [performance tests](https://github.com/scalqa/scalqa/tree/master/sample/src/example/performance), which can be tried.

Generally, the examples are structured in the same hierarchy as Scalqa API. Over time, it is expected that more and more features will 
be illustrated with runnable samples.
